# Hello, World! :milky_way:
I'm a JavaScript enthusiast interested in making code more understandable. I create courses and content, breaking down tricky concepts into clear, human-friendly lessons.

My approach to programming is rooted in communication, where I believe programming is the collaborative authoring of ideas among human programmers where code communicates the intent of the author to other human programmers.

Some stuff I worked on that I think youâ€™ll like.
