# Hello, World! :milky_way:
I'm a JavaScript developer passionate about teaching and building projects that make code more understandable. I create courses and content on JavaScript and CSS, breaking down tricky concepts into clear, human-friendly lessons. My approach to programming is rooted in communication, where I believe programming is the collaborative authoring of ideas among human programmers where code communicates the intent of the author to other human programmers.

Some stuff I worked on that I think you’ll like.
