# Hello, World! :milky_way:
Hi! I'm Ramzi, and I like to make software, videos, and courses.

I'm the creator of [slayingthedragon.io](https://slayingthedragon.io)! Outside of that, I am a web developer, JavaScript evangelist, content creator, and youtuber. I enjoy video editing, sucking at blender, hanging out with my friends and family, and reading in my free time.

You should subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@slayingthedragon)!
